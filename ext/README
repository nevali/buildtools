This directory contains m4 macros which aren't part of buildtools itself,
but are so widely-used that they're included for convenience.

These macros are not required for the proper operation of buildtools and
are distributed purely for convenience of those building needing to
re-generate configure scripts.

See the individual files for licensing terms.
